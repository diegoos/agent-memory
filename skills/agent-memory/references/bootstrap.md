# `/agent-memory bootstrap`

Analyze the project and populate the memory with real content. Uses three
analyses that run as subagents when the host supports them.

## Steps

1. **Permission gate (always).** Tell the user that bootstrap will spawn up to
   three subagents to analyze the project, and ask for explicit permission
   before continuing — **even when running under bypass/auto-approve**. If
   declined, stop.

2. **Ensure structure.** If `.agents/memory/` does not exist, run the `init`
   procedure first (`references/init.md`), then continue.

3. **Run the three analyses.** Launch them as **parallel subagents** if the host
   supports subagents (e.g. Claude Code's Task/Agent tool). If it does not, run
   the same three analyses **sequentially** in the current agent.
   - **A — Documentation.** Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, then
     `README.md` and other `.md` docs. Extract: product purpose, scope, goals.
   - **B — Structure.** Map the repo layout: backend, frontend, database,
     services, and the major areas/modules.
   - **C — Technologies.** Identify the main languages, frameworks, and tooling,
     and determine what kind of project it is.

4. **Vision gate.** Before writing `vision.md`, if purpose or scope is unclear
   from the analyses, **ask the user** — do not invent product goals.

5. **Synthesize and write (skip empties).** Wait for all three, then fill memory
   files only where there is real content — respect the lazy principle, do not
   create shallow placeholders:

   | Source        | Writes to                                            |
   | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
   | A (docs)      | `vision.md` (after vision gate)                      |
   | B (structure) | `architecture.md`, `domains/*.md` (per major area)   |
   | C (tech)      | `architecture.md` (stack), `patterns.md`             |
   | synthesis     | `current.md` (state/version), `log.md` session entry |

   - **Register every created lazy file and every `domains/*.md` /
     `features/*.md` in `index.md`** (under the matching section, replacing
     `_None yet._`). Otherwise `lint` will flag orphans.
   - Append to `log.md` using the per-session format in `instructions.md` (one
     heading + bullets), e.g. `## [YYYY-MM-DD] [docs] bootstrap initial memory`
     with a bullet list of files created.
   - Leave `active-work/` with only its `TEMPLATE.md` (no branch files), and
     **do not invent** decisions — `decisions.md` stays empty unless a genuine,
     already-made trade-off is documented in the project.

6. **Report.** List which files were created/filled and which were skipped (and
   why), so the user can fill the gaps later. If vision was uncertain, note what
   still needs user input. Tell the user to run `/agent-memory sync` at
   checkpoints to keep `current.md`, active-work, `log.md`, and `index.md`
   current.

## Subagent prompts

Pass each analysis to a subagent with `Task` (read-only). Replies must be short
and high-signal — they feed the memory, where tokens matter. **If subagents are
unavailable, run the three prompts yourself, in order.**

- **A — Documentation:**

  > Read-only task. Read the project's agent/instruction files (`AGENTS.md`,
  > `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`), then `README.md` and other top-level `*.md` docs.
  > Do not read source code. Return, in ≤150 words: the product purpose (1–2
  > sentences), scope/goals (bullets), and any stated conventions or
  > constraints. Cite the file for each fact. If something is not documented,
  > say so — never invent.

- **B — Structure:**

  > Read-only task. Map the repository layout. Identify backend, frontend,
  > database, services, and the major modules/areas. Return a concise list of
  > top-level areas, each with its role and key entry-point path(s). Flag
  > anything ambiguous. Classify from paths and manifests; avoid reading file
  > bodies unless necessary.

- **C — Technologies:**
  > Read-only task. From manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`,
  > `Cargo.toml`, etc.) and config files, identify the main languages,
  > frameworks, and build/test tooling, and decide the project type (web app,
  > library, CLI, service, monorepo…). Return: the stack (bullets), notable
  > tooling, and a one-line project-type verdict with the evidence (which file).
